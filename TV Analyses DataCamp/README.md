Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>.
